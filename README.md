# Ants
My Ants browser game for Ludum Dare 32.

Currently hosted at: www.cgmorton.com/holygophergames/ants/ants.php

The theme for this Ludum Dare was "An Unconventional Weapon", and in this game your weapon is a bunch of ants. But like many good weapons, these ants are a double edged sword.

Here's the deal: you win if an ant reaches your opponent's sandwich, but you -lose- if an ant reaches your sandwich.

You have one tool, a can of ant spray. Click anywhere on the level to spray. Ants won't walk on ant spray, though it won't kill them (they're the tough sort of ants). But be careful - you only have a limited supply in your can, and it evaporates quickly.

Sound effects recorded live and edited in Audacity, music composed in GarageBand, art drawn in KolourPaint.
